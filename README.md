# AES-128

# Overview

This project implements AES-128 on an inexpensive IO-limited FPGA.

# Components

The design is broken up into the following components to make verification easier:

- aes-top
- 
# Simulation Instructions

To run testbenches, follow the [environment setup](/doc/env-setup.md). Debian on WSL was used for the setup instructions, but the basic steps should remain the same.
